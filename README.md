# nextcloud-webhook-tokenneeded

**Nextcloud Server** `35.0.0` - Nextcloud GmbH

`WebhooksController::create()` nulls `tokenNeeded` unless the caller is a full instance admin. `update()` does not. A delegated Webhooks settings admin (not in `admin`) can store `tokenNeeded.user_ids: ["admin"]` on an existing webhook, then receive a one-hour unscoped `PERMANENT_TOKEN` app password for that uid when the event fires.

**A bad actor who was only trusted to manage webhooks can log in as `admin` (or any user they name) for one hour, skip 2FA, and read or overwrite that person's files.**

## What an attacker can do

You gave someone the **Webhooks** settings job. They are not in the `admin` group. Nextcloud still lets them edit an existing webhook so that, on the next matching event, the server **mails them a one-hour login** for any uid they list, including `admin`.

With that login they can:

- Open **all of that person's files** (not only something the webhook was supposed to see)
- **Download and overwrite** those files
- Use Files / WebDAV **as that person**
- **Skip 2FA** (this is an app password, not a password prompt)

They do not need a PHP shell on the host. They do not need to be a full instance admin. A stranger on the internet with no account cannot do this. The hole is the staffer you already trusted with webhooks, impersonating the people you did not.

---

## How I found it

`WebhooksController` is `#[AuthorizedAdminSetting(settings: Admin::class)]`. `Admin` implements `IDelegatedSettings`. That is how Nextcloud hands a settings panel to a group that is not `admin`.

`tokenNeeded` asks the server to attach auth tokens for named uids when the webhook fires. `TokenService::createEphemeralToken` mints `IToken::PERMANENT_TOKEN` with `password = null`. App password. 2FA already behind you.

PR #60543 gated **create**: unless you are a full instance admin, `tokenNeeded` is nulled. I created a webhook as delegated user `hooker` with `tokenNeeded.user_ids: ["admin"]`. Stored `tokenNeeded` was `[]`. Create is gated. For a minute that looks like a finished patch.

Then I POSTed the same body to `/webhooks/{id}`. Stored `user_ids` was `['admin']`. `update()` never copied the `if`.

PUT a file as `hooker` so `NodeCreatedEvent` fires. Cron runs `WebhookCall`. Catcher JSON has `authentication.user_ids.admin.token`. Bearer GET of the admin private witness file returned **200**, `X-User-Id: admin`.

Ways this dies without teaching you anything: update 403 (controller already matches create); create already minting tokens (#60543 not on the build); empty `authentication` in the catcher (cron did not mint); ExApp header path (the lab user is delegated `hooker`).

## The fix

Copy the create `isAdmin` null-out into `update()`. Until that ships, do not delegate Webhooks settings to non-admin groups.
